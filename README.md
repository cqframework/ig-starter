# Asthma CDS

This implementation guide is a pilot effort of the Informatics Stream of the CDC's Adapting Clinical Guidelines to the Digital Age initiative. The pilot has selected a specific, narrowly focused updated recommendation from the NHLBI's Asthma Guidelines as a focus for expression as shareable, computable artifacts.

NOTE: The content of this repository is DRAFT prepared as part of a collaboration with the NHLBI and should not in any way be construed as an endorsement of the content for clinical use by any of the agencies involved; this is an exploratory and voluntary collaboration effort to help understand and explore knowledge engineering topics as part of the guideline development process. The recommendation under consideration is a draft statement from an upcoming update of the overall [Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/guidelines-for-diagnosis-management-of-asthma).

NHLBI Update on Selected Topics in Asthma Management
Recommendation #12: For children ages 4 years and older and adults with moderate to severe persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends combination ICS/formoterol used as both daily controller and quick-relief therapy compared to either a higher-dose ICS as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy or the same-dose ICS/LABA as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy. (Strong recommendation, High certainty evidence ages 12 years and older, Moderate certainty evidence ages 4-11 years)
