### Introduction

This implementation guide is a pilot effort of the Informatics Stream of the CDC's Adapting Clinical Guidelines to the Digital Age initiative. The pilot has selected a specific, narrowly focused updated recommendation from the NHLBI's Asthma Guidelines as a focus for expression as shareable, computable artifacts.

NOTE: The content of this repository is DRAFT prepared as part of a collaboration with the NHLBI and should not in any way be construed as an endorsement of the content for clinical use by any of the agencies involved; this is an exploratory and voluntary collaboration effort to help understand and explore knowledge engineering topics as part of the guideline development process. The recommendation under consideration is a draft statement from an upcoming update of the overall [Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/guidelines-for-diagnosis-management-of-asthma).

#### Recommendation 12:

NHLBI Update on Selected Topics in Asthma Management
Recommendation #12: For children ages 4 years and older and adults with moderate to severe persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends combination ICS/formoterol used as both daily controller and quick-relief therapy compared to either a higher-dose ICS as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy or the same-dose ICS/LABA as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy. (Strong recommendation, High certainty evidence ages 12 years and older, Moderate certainty evidence ages 4-11 years)

Rationale for focus: Strong recommendation with high certainty evidence suggests moderate to severe persistent asthma, 12 years or older (versus the Moderate certainty evidence associated with the 4-11 age range).

Overall recommendation "template" is:

"These patients" should receive "these medications"

* Point-of-care
    * Order in an order set (defaulted)
    * Item that appears in a care plan
    * Intervention when prescribing/treating
* Patient-facing
    * Patient-facing, given medication list, provide guidance/educational material
* Population level
    * Population management, determine set of patients to apply (e.g. care gaps/quality measures)
    * Registry search

_decision support_ that informs _ordering_ that informs _documentation_ that informs _quality measure_
representation may vary across these functions

##### Questions

1. Would peak flow and/or drop in peak flow be useful/relevant in applying this recommendation?
2. Would the recommendation presented to a clinician be any different if the patient was known to be on the "compared to" medication regimen, versus the recommended regimen?
3. How should moderate/severe be characterized? Peak flow values?
4. Are there exclusions that we should be considering
5. Are there exceptions to the rule for patients that would otherwise be recommended?
6. Are there other concepts that would be relevant for applying this recommendation?
